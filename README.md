The Potato Disease Prediction System is an AI-powered application developed using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Streamlit that detects and classifies potato leaf diseases. It assists farmers in taking timely action by analyzing leaf images and identifying conditions such as Late Blight, Early Blight, or Healthy status. Built with Python, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, and Streamlit, the system provides an intuitive and interactive web interface for real-time disease detection.
To get started, simply clone the repository, install the required dependencies, and run the Streamlit app locally.
