Potato Leaf Disease Detection Using Computer Vision and Machine Learning

Overview
This project aims to assist farmers by automating the detection of potato plant diseases through image analysis. Utilizing computer vision and machine learning techniques, the system classifies diseases like Early Blight and Late Blight based on visual patterns observed in potato leaf images. Early identification enables timely intervention, minimizing crop damage and maximizing yield.

Highlights

Automated diagnosis of potato leaf diseases using image input

Focus on common diseases such as Early Blight and Late Blight

Robust image preprocessing including normalization and enhancement

Deep learning model (CNN) trained on real-world agricultural datasets

User-friendly web interface for instant disease prediction

Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Machine Learning: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

Libraries & Tools: TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib

Deployment Platform: Streamlit (or other, depending on usage)

Dataset: A mix of healthy and infected potato leaf images from public/custom sources

Objective
The core goal is to develop an easy-to-use diagnostic platform that allows farmers to upload photos of potato leaves and receive real-time disease predictionsâ€”empowering them to take timely action without depending solely on agricultural experts.

Workflow

Data Acquisition: Gather images of both healthy and diseased potato leaves

Preprocessing: Resize images, normalize pixels, and apply data augmentation

Model Development: Train a CNN-based classification model

Evaluation: Use metrics like accuracy, precision, and a confusion matrix to assess performance

Deployment: Integrate the model into a web-based platform for practical use

Future Scope

Expand detection to include multiple crops and a broader range of diseases

Develop a mobile application for field-level diagnosis

Enable real-time predictions via camera integration

Add multilingual support to improve usability among diverse farmer communities
