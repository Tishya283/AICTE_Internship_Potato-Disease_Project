**Potato Leaf Disease Detection Using Computer Vision and Machine Learning**

---

### **Overview**

This project helps farmers detect diseases in potato plants using image recognition. By applying computer vision and machine learning, it classifies leaf diseases like **Early Blight** and **Late Blight**, allowing for faster response and improved crop protection.

---


### **Purpose**

To empower farmers with a simple tool that diagnoses leaf diseases by uploading an image, reducing dependence on experts and enabling faster crop-saving decisions.

---

### **Key Features**

* Image-based detection of potato leaf diseases
* Classifies common diseases: Early Blight, Late Blight
* Image preprocessing for normalization and clarity
* Deep learning (CNN) model trained on real-world images
* Simple web interface for uploading images and getting results

---

### **Technologies Used**

* **Language:** Python
* **Machine Learning:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
* **Libraries/Tools:** TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib
* **Deployment:** Streamlit (or your platform)
* **Dataset:** Images of healthy and diseased potato leaves (public or custom)

---

### **Project Workflow**

1. **Data Collection:** Gather images of healthy and diseased leaves
2. **Preprocessing:** Resize, normalize, and augment the images
3. **Model Training:** Build and train a CNN-based classifier
4. **Evaluation:** Use accuracy, precision, and confusion matrix to assess the model
5. **Deployment:** Provide an easy interface for real-time predictions
