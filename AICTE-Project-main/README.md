# The Potato Leaf Disease Detection project leverages computer vision and machine learning to identify and classify diseases in potato plants by analyzing leaf images. The process includes gathering a dataset of both healthy and diseased potato leaves, preprocessing the images, and training a model—such as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)—to distinguish between different disease types. Once trained, the model is deployed in an application to assist farmers in detecting diseases like late blight and early blight. This enables timely intervention, helping to minimize crop damage and improve yield protection.
